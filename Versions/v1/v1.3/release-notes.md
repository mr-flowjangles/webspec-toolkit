# v1.3

## v1.3.0 — Domain-Aware Auth Profiles (2026-05-15)

### Problem

v1.2 made the recording → spec workflow real, but the first test recorded against a Bellese app failed immediately. Playwright launches its own fresh Chromium context for each run — incognito, no extensions, no ModHeader. Without the `uid` header that UCM (and similar Bellese apps) use as a dev backdoor, the test browser hits the live URL anonymously and never gets past the first authenticated page. The runtime is fine; the workflow is unusable for any real internal app.

### Solution

A **domain-aware auth profile** system, configured per Chrome profile via a new Settings tab in the extension. The design pivot from the original `docs/08` (where config lived in a `webspec.config.ts` at the user's repo root) was driven by v1.2 first-use feedback — the workflow is browser-centric and adding a repo-bound config means walking to a terminal, which defeats shift-left.

How it works:

1. **One-time setup.** Open the new **⚙ Settings** button on the popup. Click **+ Add profile**. Set a name (e.g. "UCM Dev"), a URL pattern (glob — `http://app.ucm-dev.cmscloud.local/*`), and N header rows (e.g. `uid` → `${runAs}`). Save.
2. **Recording.** Click **Record workflow** as before. The popup matches the active tab's URL against your profiles. If a profile matches, the naming form shows ✓ **Auth profile: UCM Dev**. If none match, the form shows "No auth profile matches this URL — spec will run unauthenticated."
3. **Save.** The matched profile's headers are resolved (substituting `${runAs}` with the recording's run-as user) and baked into `WorkflowRecording.auth`. Spec is self-contained.
4. **Render.** When `recording.auth` is present, the rendered spec destructures `context` from the Playwright fixture and emits `await context.setExtraHTTPHeaders({ ... })` between the description comment and `page.goto`. The test browser is now authenticated — same way ModHeader authenticates your real browser.

Per-Chrome-profile, not per-repo. No CLI step. Multi-app supported via multiple profiles with distinct URL patterns; the most-specific match wins.

### New

- `packages/core/src/library/auth-profile.ts` — `AuthProfile` / `AuthProfileList` zod schemas; `matchProfile(profiles, url)` (longest-pattern wins); `resolveProfileHeaders(profile, runAs)` substitutes `${runAs}` placeholders.
- `packages/core/src/library/url-glob.ts` — `matchesUrlGlob(pattern, url)` pure utility. `*` → `.*`, all other regex metacharacters escaped, fully anchored. Browser-safe.
- `packages/core/tests/library/url-glob.test.ts` — 8 tests covering wildcard placement, escaping, anchoring, empty input, non-string input.
- `packages/core/tests/library/auth-profile.test.ts` — 10 tests for `matchProfile` (most-specific wins, empty list, no match) and `resolveProfileHeaders` (substitution, case-insensitivity, multiple occurrences, empty headers).
- `packages/core/tests/render/e2e/renderer.test.ts` — 5 new tests for auth emission (omit when null, emit with context fixture, ordering, multiple headers, empty headers treated as no-auth).
- `WorkflowRecording.auth` — new optional contract field with `profileName` + resolved `headers` map. Null when no profile matched, when the user has none configured, or for pre-v1.3 recordings.
- `packages/chrome-extension/src/settings/` — full Settings page (HTML entrypoint, React app, CSS). Add/edit/delete profiles, inline editor with name + URL pattern + N-row header table.
- `packages/chrome-extension/src/shared/profiles.ts` — `loadProfiles` / `saveProfiles` / `blankProfile` chrome.storage.local accessors. Reads are zod-validated.
- New **⚙ Settings** button on the popup's idle screen → opens `chrome.tabs.create({ url: chrome.runtime.getURL('src/settings/index.html') })`.

### Changed

- `packages/core/src/render/e2e/renderer.ts` — `renderPlaywrightSpec` emits `async ({ page, context })` and `await context.setExtraHTTPHeaders({ ... })` when `recording.auth` is non-null. No auth block emitted when `recording.auth` is null OR `headers` is empty.
- `packages/core/src/types/analysis.ts` — `WorkflowRecordingSchema` adds optional `auth: { profileName: string; headers: Record<string, string> } | null` field.
- `packages/core/src/browser.ts` — re-exports `matchProfile`, `resolveProfileHeaders`, `matchesUrlGlob`, and the auth schemas.
- `packages/chrome-extension/src/popup/App.tsx` — recorder state's `naming`/`starting`/`recording` variants carry `matchedProfile: AuthProfile | null`. `handleRecordToggle` becomes async, looks up the active tab URL + loaded profiles, matches before entering naming state. `stopAndReviewRecording` resolves the matched profile's headers and bakes `recording.auth` at stop time. `hydrateRecorderStatus` re-matches against `recording.startUrl` when restoring an in-flight session. New Settings button (⚙) opens the settings tab.
- `packages/chrome-extension/src/popup/NamingForm.tsx` — accepts `matchedProfile` prop; renders a non-blocking auth hint (✓ matched profile name, or "No auth profile matches…").
- `packages/chrome-extension/src/popup/popup.css` — styles for `.naming-form-auth-hint`, `.naming-form-auth-ok`, `.naming-form-auth-none`, `.settings-btn`.
- `packages/chrome-extension/vite.config.ts` — `rollupOptions.input` adds `settings: 'src/settings/index.html'`.
- `packages/chrome-extension/manifest.config.ts` — `web_accessible_resources` includes the settings page.
- `packages/chrome-extension/src/popup/App.tsx` footer — bumped to `v1.3.0 — domain-aware auth profiles`.
- `docs/08-test-library.md` — v1.3 section rewritten for the extension-Settings-driven model (replacing the original repo-bound `webspec.config.ts` design).

### Fixed

- The auth gap from v1.2 — tests recorded against authenticated Bellese apps now actually run authenticated, no terminal step required.
